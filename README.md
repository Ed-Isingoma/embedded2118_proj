## Project Description
The Quick Alert Fire System's innovativeness stems from its ability to go beyond traditional fire alarm capabilities by incorporating remote notification and escalation features. By addressing the user challenge of ensuring timely alerts in the absence of physical presence, this system improves the dependability and effectiveness of fire safety measures. It ensures that responsible individuals can take immediate action to mitigate potential fire damage, even when they are not on the premises, resulting in a comprehensive and proactive fire alert solution.

- Early Detection: To ensure the early detection of potential fire hazards,  use hardware sensors like the DHT11 to continuously monitor temperature and environmental conditions.
- Remote Notifications: When predetermined thresholds are surpassed, use the Arduino Uno microcontroller and SIM800L GSM module to send SMS alerts to specific individuals in real time.
- Escalation Mechanism: To make sure that important alerts are not disregarded,  will trigger automated phone calls.
